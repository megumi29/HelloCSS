            <p> Rewarding Memories is an app for families who would like to provide experiences in a more rewarding and
                memorable way. This app is intended to build character and gain responsibilities for younger family
                members, while also trying to break the well-known cycle of “expecting an allowance without having to
                work for it”.</p>
