                <p> Rewarding Memories is an app for families who would like to provide experiences in a more rewarding
                    and
                    memorable way. This app is intended to build character and gain responsibilities for younger family
                    members, while also trying to break the well-known cycle of “expecting an allowance without having
                    to
                    work for it”.</p>
